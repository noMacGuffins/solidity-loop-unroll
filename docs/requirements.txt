# Older versions of sphinx-rtd-theme do not work with never docutils but have a bug in the dependency
# which could result in it being installed anyway and the style (especially bullet points) being broken.
# See https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/1115
# theme >=3.0.0 removes the display_version option in favor of version_selector and language_selector
# Use rtd theme version that supports sphinx>=8.0
sphinx_rtd_theme>=3.0.0

pygments-lexer-solidity>=0.7.0
sphinx-syntax>=1.0.1

# Sphinx version constraints for sphinx-syntax compatibility
sphinx>=8.0.0, <9.0.0
